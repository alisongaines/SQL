Project: Famous People
In this project, you’re going to make your own table with some small set of “famous people”.
Make more tables about things they do and join those to create nice human readable lists.



/* Create table about most famous female singers */

    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT, 
    age INTEGER,
