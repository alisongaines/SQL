#For this project, I dowloaded the Chinook Digital Media store's sample database from https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/

#For this project, I curated a list of basic and detailed questions to perform an analysis of Chinook's dataset. 




#The following SQL was written to answer basic questions to familiarize myself with the store's data:

#1. How many employees work at Chinook?
SELECT COUNT(EmployeeId) 
FROM chinook.employees;

#2. What are the employee roles at Chinook?
SELECT DISTINCT Title 
FROM chinook.employees;

#3. How many employees are in each role?
SELECT COUNT(EmployeeId), Title 
FROM chinook.employees
GROUP BY Title;

#4. How many total customers are in this dataset?
SELECT COUNT(CustomerId)
FROM chinook.customers;

#5. How many countries have purchased from Chinook? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) 
FROM chinook.customers;

#6. Which countries have purchased from Chinook?
SELECT DISTINCT Country
FROM chinook.customers;

#7. What is this store's total number of sales?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId)
FROM chinook.invoices;

#8. What is this store's total earned in sales?
SELECT SUM(Total)

#9. What is the date range of this store's sales data?
SELECT MIN(InvoiceDate), MAX(InvoiceDate)

SELECT COUNT(Name) FROM chinook.media_types;
SELECT Name FROM chinook.playlists;
SELECT Count(PlaylistId) FROM chinook.playlists;




#The following SQL was written to do a deep dive and analysis of the store's data:

#1. Which agents had the most customers?
SELECT 
    DISTINCT c.SupportRepId AS Agent, 
    COUNT(C.CustomerId) AS TotalCustomers, 
    e.FirstName, 
    e.LastName
FROM chinook.customers c
    JOIN chinook.employees e ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
GROUP BY Agent
ORDER BY TotalCustomers DESC;

#2. Which agents sold the most in price? How much did they sell?
SELECT 
    DISTINCT SUM(i.Total) AS TotalCost, 
    c.SupportRepId AS Agent, 
    e.FirstName, 
    e.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices i
    JOIN chinook.customers c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
    JOIN chinook.employees e ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
GROUP BY Agent
ORDER BY TotalCost DESC;

#3. Which country had the highest number of sales with how many invoices? How many customers are from that country? What was the total earned in sales from that country?
SELECT 
    BillingCountry, 
    COUNT(InvoiceId) AS InvoiceCount, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerId) AS CustomerCount, 
    ROUND(SUM(Total)) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY BillingCountry
ORDER BY InvoiceCount DESC;

#4. Which country had the lowest number in sales with how many invoices? How many customers are from there? What was the total earned in sales from there?
SELECT 
    BillingCountry,
    COUNT(InvoiceId) AS InvoiceCount,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerId) AS CustomerCount,
    ROUND(SUM(Total)) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY BillingCountry
ORDER BY InvoiceCount;

#5. How many invoices were there each year? Which year(s) had the highest total sales?
SELECT 
    strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate) AS Year,
    COUNT(InvoiceId) AS 'TotalInvoices'
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY Year
ORDER BY TotalInvoices DESC;

#6. Write a query that shows all tracks, album name, media type, and genre.
SELECT 
    a.Title AS Album, 
    t.Name AS TrackName, 
    g.Name AS Genre, 
    m.Name AS MediaType
FROM chinook.tracks t
    JOIN chinook.genres g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
    JOIN chinook.media_types m ON t.MediaTypeId = m.MediaTypeId
    JOIN chinook.albums a ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
ORDER BY Album;

#7. What is the most popular genre from Canada?
SELECT Genre, COUNT(*) AS GenreCount
FROM (
    SELECT g.Name AS Genre
    FROM chinook.invoices i
    JOIN chinook.invoice_items ii ON i.InvoiceId = ii.InvoiceId
    JOIN chinook.tracks t ON ii.TrackId = t.TrackId
    JOIN chinook.genres g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
    WHERE i.BillingCountry = 'Canada'
) AS Subquery
GROUP BY Genre
ORDER BY GenreCount DESC;

#8. What are this store's top 3 most popular playlists?
SELECT PlaylistName, COUNT(*) AS PlaylistCount
FROM (
    SELECT p.name AS PlaylistName
    FROM chinook.invoice_items i
    JOIN chinook.playlist_track pt ON i.TrackId = pt.TrackId
    JOIN chinook.playlists p ON pt.PlaylistId = p.PlaylistId
) AS Subquery
GROUP BY PlaylistName
ORDER BY PlaylistCount DESC LIMIT 3;
